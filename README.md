*Offering these services would improve Ripple labs because three major compoptenets are 

Digital Asset Protection: Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that have monetary value. Ensuring the security of these assets is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, theft, or loss. Unlike traditional financial systems, there is no central authority to recover lost or stolen cryptocurrencies.

This decentralization aims to eliminate single points of failure and control, making security essential to maintain the integrity of the network.

Irreversible Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible once confirmed on the blockchain. If a transaction is compromised or fraudulent, there is no way to reverse it. This underscores the importance of ensuring that transactions are secure and accurate.
